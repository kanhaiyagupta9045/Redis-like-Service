### Redis

### To runserver
```
$ go run main.go
```
### To check the different commands

```
Step 1 : http://localhost:8080/operation you have to make POST request on this url

Step 2 : {
  "operation": "SET key_b 3 EX 60 XX"
} you have to pass json data like this 

STEP 3 : For checking different commands you have to change json data 
like as :
{
  "operation": "GET key_b"
}

```
### Working
```
When making a POST request, the JSON data is first validated. Then, depending on the specific command, the request is processed accordingly
```
